# Meal mate
An iOS app that shows images of recipies on searched items. Default search is yoghurt.
API from Spoonacular

![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/650a6f15ffdbf877/status.svg?token=l_mXlLh8QeGUikJJLoSkVg)

## Additional notes
The API I choose (Spoonacular) https://spoonacular.com/ only allows 150 requests per day.


## What I would include if I had more time
I would add tests for the strings and viewModel. 
The API has a lot of different fields such as nutritional value, cusine and recipies. I would allow the user to click on the image to view the recipie in app. I would include a world map so a user could see cuisine all over the world.
